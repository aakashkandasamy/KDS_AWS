Our groundbreaking Python project utilizes cutting-edge technologies, including machine learning, streamlit, Amazon Polly, and ResNet50, to create an innovative solution that addresses the needs of visually impaired students in the chemistry lab. With over 10,000 training images, our machine learning model accurately classifies images of lab equipment and notes the colors of liquids inside test tubes, with more than 95% accuracy, providing visually impaired students with real-time audio feedback to navigate the lab environment with confidence. 

The use of Amazon Polly ensures that the audio output is high-quality, natural-sounding, and easy to understand. Our ResNet50-based model is a state-of-the-art solution in image classification tasks, making our solution highly effective and accurate. With our user-friendly streamlit interface, our solution provides a simple and intuitive way for visually impaired students to engage with the subject matter on their own terms. Overall, our project has the potential to significantly transform the educational experience of visually impaired students by making the learning process more accessible, inclusive, and empowering. This is our submission for the AIFINITY Hackathon 2023.
